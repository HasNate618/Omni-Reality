# Omni spatial loop (slices 0-2)

What it is: the offline Quest 3S + laptop drawing loop. The headset captures
the scene and plants world-locked marks; the laptop coordinator authors scene
ops over LAN; Unity renders and ACKs. No model calls in these slices.

## Contract (short form)

- Canonical camera is **left** (`PassthroughCameraAccess`, 1280x960); world
  frame is `openxr_floor_stage` (Unity left-handed, metres, quaternions xyzw).
- Every placement uses the **capture-time** pose and ray, not the current head
  pose. Per-`frame_id` geometry is cached for 10 s (`CaptureGeometryCache`).
- A `world_hint` is one capture-time hit (`pointing` or `centre`); the 0.12 m
  stale rule compares the **same ray** only. Hits valid between 0.25 m and 4 m.
- A `mark` with no motion defaults to a pulsing ring (period 1.2 s, 0.06 m
  ring). Pulse runs at headset framerate and must stay on the surface while
  the wearer walks — never stuck to the head.
- Laptop → Quest `scene_op`s go over one WebSocket as JSON text frames, no
  TLS. Quest replies with a `PlacementAck` (`placed` / `rejected` / `stale`).
  No success is claimed before the ACK. `cancel`/`ack` send before any frame
  bytes; drawings stay on Quest if the socket dies.
- Misses are honest chips, never floating pins: no-surface "I can't plant
  that on a surface.", stale "That moved, look again.", too-close "Too close
  for depth.", socket down "Laptop not connected."
- **No yibuapi in these slices.** The coordinator never imports model code and
  never reads an API key; Unity has no key path and never POSTs anywhere.

## Pointers

- Binding design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-19-spatial-omni-assistant-design.md`
  (§14 build order; this doc covers slices 0 contract, 1 envelope+pin, 2 LAN).
- Build plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-19-spatial-omni-slices-0-2.md`.
- JSON Schemas (authoritative, not repeated here):
  `provider/protocol/schemas/` (`message`, `capture_envelope`, `scene_op`,
  `model_scene_op`, `placement_ack`).
- Coordinator: `provider/coordinator/server.py`, run from `provider/` with
  `python -m coordinator.server` (binds `ws://0.0.0.0:8765`).
- Unity side: `QuestDemo/Assets/Spatial/` (`SpatialRuntime`, `PlacementResolver`,
  `PulsingRing`, `HonestyChip`, `CoordinatorClient`, `CaptureGeometryCache`).

## How to verify

- Offline (no credit, no headset): from `provider/`,
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — schema, uv-convention, stale,
  coordinator, and send-priority tests.
- Headset, slice 1: native build (XR Simulator has no PCA), plant the ring on
  a real table, walk ~90 degrees — pulse stays on the table. Then force a
  miss: chip appears, nothing floats mid-air.
- LAN, slice 2: set the Quest `laptop_ipv4` to the laptop LAN address, plant
  via one laptop-authored `mark` after a `hello` — ring appears and the
  coordinator logs `ack status=placed`. Unplug Wi-Fi: rings remain, chip shows
  offline. Recordings stay gitignored (`provider/artifacts/`).
- Note: the headset and LAN pass/fail steps above are the acceptance gate for
  slices 1-2 and have **not** been run on device in this worktree; Python
  tests are the offline gate.
